# AmperageAtPhone-release
Releases for the AmperageAtPhone application

AmperageAtPhone is a Unity based game simulation for the FIRST FRC INFINITE RECHARCE at Home 2021 Seaon.

This game simulation was born from the Ross Rambotics program in Ross Township, Ohio.  Our 2020 competition robot was/is named "Amperage" and this simulation is dedicated to all the hardwork by the student and mentors and is only possible due to the support from the Ross Local Schools and our sponsors.  Please visit our website to learn more.
